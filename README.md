# Compuneers

**Compuneers** ("Computer" + "Pioneers") is a project designed to highlight the contributions of women, BIPOC, and LGBT+ figures in the field of Computer Science. Each figure is featured in their own post on the [Compuneers site](#), and indexed in the [Figure List](./Figure-List.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, encouraged, and needed! There are so many people's stories to tell. Consider contributing by writing a post for a figure or tackling an issue in the codebase, but please see the [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) docs for more information before submitting a Pull Request.
