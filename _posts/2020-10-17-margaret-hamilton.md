## Work

From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft. She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories. The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense from potential Soviet attacks during the Cold War.

## Biography

Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington); she has two younger siblings: David and Kathryn. The family later moved to Michigan, where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954. She studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College where her mother was a student; she earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958. She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor. She had other inspirations including her father (a philosopher and poet), and her grandfather (a school headmaster and Quaker minister). She says these men inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.

While at Earlham, Hamilton met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton, a senior majoring in chemistry. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham. She briefly taught high school mathematics and French at a public school in Boston, Indiana, while her husband completed his undergraduate degree at Earlham. The couple then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where James would later earn his master's degree in chemistry from Brandeis University; they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959. James later graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963; he founded a law firm in Boston and also later served on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. The couple divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.
