Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington);[2][3] she has two younger siblings: David[4][5] and Kathryn.[6] The family later moved to Michigan,[7] where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954.[2] She studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College where her mother was a student;[8][9] she earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958.[8][10] She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor.[11] She had other inspirations including her father (a philosopher and poet), and her grandfather (a school headmaster and Quaker minister). She says these men inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.[12]

While at Earlham, Hamilton met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton,[13] a senior majoring in chemistry. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham.[14][13] She briefly taught high school mathematics and French at a public school in Boston, Indiana, while her husband completed his undergraduate degree at Earlham.[14][15] The couple then moved to Boston, Massachusetts,[15] where James would later earn his master's degree in chemistry from Brandeis University;[13] they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959.[2] James later graduated from Harvard Law School in 1963; he founded a law firm in Boston and also later served on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union.[13] The couple divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.[13][16]
