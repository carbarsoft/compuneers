Compuneers aims to shed light on the unsung pioneers of the Computer Science field, particularly women and BIPOC. This is an on-going, collaborative project, and more figures from history will be added over time. If you'd like to help contribute to the project, visit the [Compuneers source code](https://github.com/timmybytes/compuneers) page.
