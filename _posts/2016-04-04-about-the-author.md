Hey there! I'm [Timothy Merritt](https://timmybytes.com), a web developer/writer/musician person passionate about accessibility and inclusivity in tech. I started this project as a way to highlight marginalized stories in the history of computing, and as a way to collaborate with other developers for [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).
