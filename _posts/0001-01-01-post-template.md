This is one example of a post written in `markdown`. It should contain some combination of the following content to be added to the site.

## Work

The work section should include anything available on the figure's specialty, contributions to Computer Science, etc, along with links to their work or to other aspects of CS influenced by the figure's work.

An example might be: Grace Hopper invented the [FLOW-MATIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC) programming language, which subsequently played an important role in the creation of [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL).

## Biography

The biography section can include anything relating to the figure's life.

An example for Grace Hopper might be: Hopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.

Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).

## (Optional) Awards and/or Accolades

Examples:

* World War II Victory Medal (1945)
* Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Society's highest honor, "In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems." In May 1955, Hopper was one of the founding members of the Society of Women Engineers (1964)
* Defense Distinguished Service Medal (1986)
* etc. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#Awards_and_honors)

## (Optional) Trivia/Interesting Facts

Examples:

Throughout much of her later career, Grace Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname "Grandma COBOL".[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#Anecdotes)

While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay. While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase "debugging" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal "debugging." For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering. The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#Anecdotes)
