To contribute a new figure post to the project, start by opening an issue for a specific figure according to the instructions below.

## Adding a figure to the Figure List

1. Open a [new figure issue](https://github.com/timmybytes/compuneers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=add-a-new-figure.md&title=), and fill in the required fields to discuss the proposed addition with maintainers, and to ensure the figure is a good fit for the project:

   - The figure should be a woman, a person of color, and/or LGBTQIA+. This rule is very flexible, but keep in mind the project is specifically meant to lift up overlooked and marginalized figures in Computer Science history. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are not the target demographic to feature here.
   - The figure should work or have worked in or contributed to the general field of Computer Science in a meaningful way.
   - There should be credible sources (preferably at least two separate sources) to draw from and cite for a post.

2. If approved/assigned:
   - Fork the repo
   - Add the figure to the [FIGURES](https://github.com/timmybytes/compuneers/blob/main/FIGURES.md) file with the appropriate resource links in the following format:
     - `Figure Name` as h2 heading
     - `Figure ID` as first three letters of figure's last name + 001 (or 002 if 001 is taken, etc)
     - `Sources`
       - `Links`
     - `Status: Not Published`
   - Submit a PR with this change (please do not create new post for a figure until this PR has been reviewed and merged)

3. Continue with the below steps

## Writing about a figure already in the Figure List

1. Open a new [new figure post issue](https://github.com/timmybytes/compuneers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=write-a-new-figure-post.md&title=New+Figure+Post+-+%5BFigure+Name+Here%5D).
2. Wait until you're assigned the figure you're interested in, then:
   - Fork the repo
   - Create a new file in the `_posts` directory that follows the [post template](https://timmybytes.github.io/compuneers/meta/post-template.html)


## Style Guide

Posts should use the [post template](https://timmybytes.github.io/compuneers/meta/post-template.html) as a style guide.
